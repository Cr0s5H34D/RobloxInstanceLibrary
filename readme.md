The Roblox Instance Library is a Library of roblox's Instances. Avalable through the RBXM / Roblox Toolbox / Roblox Studio MarketPlace
This contains every object, alphabetical order and such.
Just some objects will not be in there, that's why an extra file is there to show every single object that was never included in the list
Please enjoy the file you've been given.
